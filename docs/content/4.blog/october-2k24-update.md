### New contributor & contributions

![Sandros94](/img/sandros94.png)

Meet [Sandros94](https://github.com/Sandros94), he joined the project and has made significant contributions already!
Thanks to his work we accelerated the progression of the module and even more features are coming soon like a fully typed API. 
Absolutely exciting, stay tuned to learn more!

### No more composables

With the new release we got rid of the composables in favor of a agnostic- and utility-first approach.
This means that you can use any method you want to make API calls to your Coolify instance with your own preferred Auth.

### Bring your own Auth

We believe in a agnostic- and utility-first approach and don't want to decide for you, so bring your own auth to connect with your Coolify and cloud provider services like Hetzner and Vultr. 

## The road ahead and what's next?

We are working on a fully typed API and much more, stay tuned to find out!

### Nitro Community

We have also become part of the Nitro community, stay tuned to learn more!

### Built-in Coolify Preset coming to Nitro

We are started working on a Coolify Nitro preset in private together with [pi0](https://github.com/pi0), this is an effort to stay in line with the Nitro community and guidelines, making the module safer through standardized practices and making it easier to use for a wider audience.
