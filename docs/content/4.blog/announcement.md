# Introducing nuxt-coolify


<!-- ![image](/heyokajs-announce.png) -->


### Introduction 

This module helps as a alternative to self-hosting platforms as Vercel and Cloudflare. Using Nuxt you can easily craft your own custom dashboard or platform around self host Coolify. Sounds amazing in my ears.

### Roadmap

- Currently planned to cover the full Coolify API for full automation.
- Typed request and response events.
- & more!

Stay Tuned!
