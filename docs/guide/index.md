# Introduction

Nuxt is a free and open-source full stack framework you can use to create performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Powered by Nitro, offering APIs and server side rendering.

Coolify is an all-in one PaaS that helps you to self-host your own applications (Vite, Vue, Nuxt, Reaact, Next & much more), databases or services (like Wordpress, Plausible Analytics, Ghost) without managing your servers, also known as an open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.

This Nuxt Coolify module is a logical step forward that enables you to gain direct access to your deployments and/or create new projects/servers/applications over Nuxt and Nitro Lifecycles/API calls over Coolify's API within your existing or future Nuxt applications.
