## Configuration

To use a cloud provider, you'll need to add the appropriate environment variables:

### Hetzner Configuration

```bash
NUXT_COOLIFY_PROVIDERS_HETZNER_BASE_URL=<hetzner-api-url>
NUXT_COOLIFY_PROVIDERS_HETZNER_API_TOKEN=<your-hetzner-api-token>
```

## Usage Example

Here's how to use the provider APIs in your Nuxt application:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { 
  data: servers, 
  refresh: refreshServers 
} = useFetch('/api/v1/hetzner/servers')
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Hetzner Servers</h2>
    <pre>{{ servers }}</pre>
    <button @click="refreshServers">
      Refresh Servers
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```
