## Migration from Vitepress to Nuxt UI Pro Docs

We're excited to announce our migration from Vitepress to Nuxt UI Pro Docs! This transition brings several key improvements to our documentation:

- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with the Nuxt ecosystem and Nuxt Studio
- **Improved Search Functionality**: Better content discovery with fuzzy search
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout that works great on all devices
- **Deeper TypeScript Support**: Better type safety and autocompletion

With the major update v0.1.0, we've implemented this new documentation project to facilitate further development of the module in the long term. This aligns with our ongoing discussions about enhanced integration capabilities, particularly regarding multiple Coolify instances and provider accounts like Hetzner.

Sandro again helped a ton with the migration and updating everything to the latest Nuxt UI Pro version for the past months, we held off this migration for a while because we wanted to wait on the new v3 of the Nuxt UI Pro Docs to land.

### Nitro Community

We have also become part of the Nitro community, stay tuned to learn more!

### Built-in Coolify Preset coming to Nitro

We are started working on a Coolify Nitro preset in private together with [pi0](https://github.com/pi0), this is an effort to stay in line with the Nitro community and guidelines, making the module safer through standardized practices and making it easier to use for a wider audience.
