# Introduction

Nuxt is an open-source, full-stack framework for building high-performance, production-ready web applications and websites using Vue.js. It leverages Nitro to provide robust APIs and server-side rendering capabilities.

Coolify is a comprehensive, cloud and self-hostable Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution. It allows you to deploy and manage your own applications (including those built with Vite, Vue, Nuxt, React, Next.js, and many others), databases, and services (such as WordPress, Plausible Analytics, and Ghost) without the complexity of server management. Coolify positions itself as an open-source, self-hostable alternative to platforms like Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel.

The Nuxt Coolify module represents a natural progression in web development tooling. It provides seamless integration between Nuxt applications and Coolify's infrastructure, allowing developers to interact directly with their deployments and create new projects, servers, or applications. This interaction is facilitated through Nuxt and Nitro lifecycles, as well as API calls to Coolify's interface. The module enhances the capabilities of both existing and future Nuxt applications by bridging the gap between development and deployment environments.
